# GradeCalc
Grade calculator inspired by ChatGPT. Learning Kotlin
-->SUGGESTIONS BY CHATGPT<--
Your code looks good overall, and it achieves the goal of calculating grades based on the user's input. Here are a few suggestions for improvement:

1. **Function Naming**: In Programming, it is good to add descriptive names to the functions. Muc as yours are desciptive, can be improved to follow the standard naming convention.

2. **Use Data Classes**: As you mentioned in the comments, using a `Subject` class would be a better approach. Instead of using a mutable list of doubles, you can create a data class called `Subject` that holds the subject name and grade. Then you can use a list of `Subject` objects to store the subjects and their grades. This approach provides better structure and type safety.

3. **Handle Invalid Input**: Currently, your code assumes that the user will always provide valid input. It would be a good idea to handle cases where the user enters invalid input, such as non-numeric grades or negative numbers. You can add validation checks and error handling to ensure the program handles such scenarios gracefully.

4. **Extract Constants**: Instead of hard-coding the grade ranges and their corresponding meanings in the `giveGradeMeaning()` function, you can define them as constants at the top of your code. This makes it easier to modify and maintain the grade ranges in the future.

5. **Consider Using an `if else` Statement**: While the `when` statement works fine for your current implementation, if you anticipate adding more grade ranges or more complex conditions in the future, you might consider using an if-else ladder or a map-based approach for better readability and flexibility.

These suggestions will help improve the structure, readability, and maintainability of your code. However, they are optional and depend on the complexity and requirements of your specific project.
